I am now pursuing my Ph.D. career in *Artificial Intelligence* in College of Computer Science and Technology, *Zhejiang University*, China, supervised by Prof. [Chao Wu](https://wuchaozju.github.io/). Before that, I received my bachelor degree in *Engineering* from Zhejiang University (ZJU); meanwhile, I obtained an *honorary undergraduate degree* from Chu Kochen Honors College of ZJU. My main research interests lie in **Collaborative and Distributed Machine Learning** and **Trustworthy and Generalized Deep Learning**.

## Research Interests
* **Collaborative and Distributed Machine Learning**
  * Federated deep Learning: algorithm design in terms of *generalization*, *personalization*, *robustness*, and *efficiency* & *training dynamics* understanding.
  * Edge-cloud collaborative & domain-transferred machine learning: *real-world applications*.
  * Socio-technical issues brought by *big data* and *machine learning*.

* **Trustworthy and Generalized Deep Learning**
  * Collaborative, privacy-preserving, robust, fair, and secure deep learning.
  * Understanding training dynamics and generalization of deep neural networks.
