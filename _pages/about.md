I am now pursuing my Ph.D. career in College of Computer Science and Technology, *Zhejiang University*, China. Before that, I received my bachelor degree in *Engineering* from Zhejiang University (ZJU); meanwhile, I obtained an *honorary undergraduate degree* from Chu Kochen Honors College of ZJU. My main research interests lie in **Collaborative Machine Learning** and **Big Data Governace**.

## Research Interests
* **Collaborative Machine Learning**
  * Federated deep Learning: *efficient* & *robust* algorithm design and *generalization* & *training dynamics* understanding.
  * Decentralized (peer-to-peer) federated learning: effective communication topology and *clustered heterogeneity*.
  * Device-cloud collaborative machine learning: *personalization* and real-time performance, especially the adaptation in *recommendation system*.
  * Domain-transferred machine learning: effective tools in *real-world applications*.

* **Big Data Governance**
  * Data rights and open science: *model sharing beyond data sharing*.
  * Computational social science from big data: *data-driven techniques* and public affairs study.
