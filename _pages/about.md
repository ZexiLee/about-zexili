I am now pursuing my Ph.D. career in *Artificial Intelligence* in College of Computer Science and Technology, *Zhejiang University*, China, supervised by Prof. [Chao Wu](https://wuchaozju.github.io/). Before that, I received my bachelor degree in *Engineering* from Zhejiang University (ZJU); meanwhile, I obtained an *honorary undergraduate degree* from Chu Kochen Honors College of ZJU. My main research interests lie in **Collaborative Machine Learning** and **Big Data Governace**.

## Research Interests
* **Collaborative Machine Learning**
  * Federated deep Learning: *efficient* & *robust* algorithm design and *generalization* & *training dynamics* understanding.
  * Decentralized (peer-to-peer) federated learning: effective communication topology and *clustered heterogeneity*.
  * Device-cloud collaborative machine learning: *personalization* and real-time performance, especially the adaptation in *recommendation system*.
  * Domain-transferred machine learning: effective tools in *real-world applications*.

* **Big Data Governance**
  * Data rights and open science: *model sharing beyond data sharing*.
  * Computational social science from big data: *data-driven techniques* and public affairs study.

## Recent News

* **\[2022.11\]** Our paper "Towards Effective Clustered Federated Learning: A Peer-to-peer Framework with Adaptive Neighbor Matching" has been accepted by _IEEE Transactions on Big Data_! This paper had been through a dark time in the last year, and the acceptance means a lot to me. Congratulations to myself!
* **\[2022.10\]** I have passed *the Mid-term Assessment of Doctoral Program*.
* **\[2022.10\]** I am presented with *Outstanding Postgraduate Student Award* on 2021-2022 by Zhejiang University.
* **\[2022.09\]** Our new perspective paper "Can we share models if sharing data is not an option?" is accepted by _Patterns, Cell Press_. _Patterns_ is a child-journal about _data science_ of Cell Press, and it will have a first strong impact factor in 2023.
